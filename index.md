I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student at George Mason University, working with <a href="https://craigyuyu.github.io/home/index.html">Prof. Craig Yu</a> in the Design Computing and Extended Reality Group (DCXR). 
<br />
Previously, I received my M.S. degree from Ewha Womans University, Seoul, South Korea under the supervision of <a href="http://home.ewha.ac.kr/~kimy/">Prof. Young J. Kim</a>.
