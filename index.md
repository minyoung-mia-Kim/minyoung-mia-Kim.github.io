👩‍💻 Ph.D. student @ George Mason Univeristy
<br />
<br />
I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student at George Mason University, working with <a href="https://craigyuyu.github.io/home/index.html">Prof. Craig Yu</a> in the Design Computing and Extended Reality Group (DCXR). Previously, I received my M.S. degree under the supervision of <a href="http://home.ewha.ac.kr/~kimy/">Prof. Young J. Kim</a>.
<br />
<br />
My research focuses on AR/VR/XR experience synthesis and representation, grounded in in-context human and scene understanding. I’m passionate about embodying what we imagine on top of what we perceive, seamlessly blending into the real world.
